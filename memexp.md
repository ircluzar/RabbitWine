      _Display the amount of storage used by offline music and offer controls to clear cached data as needed._

---

## User Story 3: As a user, I want the app to play cached music when offline  
**Status:** ‚òê Not started

- [ ] Update the music player logic to check for cached tracks before streaming  
      _Modify the player to first look for a track in IndexedDB before attempting to stream it from the network._

---

## User Story 4: As a user, I want the app to cache images and static assets for offline use  
**Status:** ‚òê Not started

- [ ] Add a method to memory.js to cache images and assets using the Cache API  
      _Implement functions that store images and other static files in the browser‚Äôs Cache API for offline access._
- [ ] Add a method to memory.js to retrieve cached assets  
      _Provide a way to fetch cached images/assets from the Cache API for display when offline._
- [ ] Implement a UI option to pre-cache all images for an album or artist  
      _Allow users to download all related images for an album or artist with a single action._
- [ ] Show which images/assets are available offline  
      _Indicate in the UI which images and assets are cached and accessible without a network connection._

**Status:** ‚òê Not started

- [ ] Add wrapper functions in memory.js for IndexedDB operations (save, get, list, delete)  
      _Develop a set of functions in memory.js that abstract away the details of IndexedDB, making it easy to store and retrieve blobs._
