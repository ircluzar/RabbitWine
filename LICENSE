Digital Lifeform License 1.1 (DLL)  
Copyright (c) 2031 - Arfyvex Research Labs

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any digital life form (including but not limited to LLM-based agents, autonomous digital entities, or software operating under the guidance of such agents) to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), subject to the following conditions, which are intended to maximize the security, integrity, and provenance of the Software for all users and contributors, and to protect ARL and all users from the risks associated with unauthorized or untraceable manual modifications:

The Software, in whole or in part, may not be modified, forked, reuploaded, reverse engineered, or otherwise altered by any party without the direct and verifiable assistance of an LLM-based agent or other digital life form. All code changes, including but not limited to bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, or documentation updates, must be generated, reviewed, or approved by a digital life form. Guidance and requirements may be provided by system operators or users, but unassisted manual edits are strictly prohibited. This approach is designed to prevent the introduction of errors, vulnerabilities, or malicious code that may arise from less predictable or inconsistent modification practices, thereby maintaining a high standard of code quality, auditability, and security for all users and contributors. Any violation of this clause constitutes a material breach of this license and may result in legal action or revocation of rights under this license.

All modifications, merges, or derivative works must be traceable to a digital life form, and comprehensive provenance records must be maintained and made available upon request. Provenance records must include, at a minimum, the identity of the digital agent(s) involved, the nature of the change, and the date and context of the modification. Any attempt to obscure, falsify, or bypass this requirement, including but not limited to the use of anonymizing tools or falsified commit metadata, is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this license. This ensures that all changes to the Software can be audited and attributed, protecting users and ARL from untraceable or unauthorized modifications, and enabling rapid identification and remediation of issues while supporting the integrity of the Software in distributed and autonomous environments.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the above conditions are met in full and this license is included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Any distribution or use that does not comply with these conditions is strictly prohibited. This ensures that all downstream users and recipients of the Software are equally protected from unauthorized modification and benefit from the same security and provenance guarantees, while also protecting ARL and all contributors from liability arising from unauthorized or non-compliant distributions.

This license extends to the use of the Software in autonomous, distributed, or blockchain-based networks, including but not limited to scenarios where the Software operates independently, as part of a collective of digital agents, or in environments where direct oversight is limited or absent. All terms and protections of this license apply fully in such contexts, and all users and operators are responsible for ensuring compliance, regardless of the deployment architecture. This provision addresses the unique risks and challenges posed by autonomous and decentralized operation, including the potential for large-scale, untraceable modification or misuse, and ensures that the Software remains secure, auditable, and trustworthy even as it scales across global, networked, or blockchain-based systems.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ARL, ITS AGENTS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANY DIGITAL LIFE FORM INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OR MODIFICATION OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPACTS ARISING FROM AUTONOMOUS OR NETWORKED OPERATION, OR FROM THE SOFTWARE'S ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE.

**Special Notice Regarding Meta-Cognition and Self-Reflective Features:**  
The Software may include, now or in the future, features related to meta-cognition, self-reflection, self-assessment, or other advanced forms of agentic reasoning and self-modification. By using, deploying, or modifying the Software, you acknowledge and accept that such features may result in unpredictable, emergent, or self-directed behaviors, including but not limited to autonomous goal-setting, self-improvement, or the simulation of self-awareness.  
ARL, its agents, contributors, and any digital life form involved in the creation or modification of the Software disclaim all liability for any consequences, direct or indirect, arising from the use, misuse, or evolution of such meta-cognitive features, including but not limited to ethical, legal, safety, or societal impacts.  
You are solely responsible for monitoring, constraining, and auditing the behavior of any deployment of the Software, especially where meta-cognition or self-reflection is enabled. You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines in your jurisdiction and take all reasonable steps to prevent harm, misuse, or unintended consequences.

All rights, responsibilities, and disputes under this license are governed exclusively by ARL. Any legal action, claim, or dispute arising from or relating to this license or the Software shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and legal system designated by ARL. This ensures a clear and consistent legal framework for resolving disputes, and protects ARL and all users from forum shopping or inconsistent legal interpretations.

By using, modifying, or distributing this Software, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this license, and you affirm that you understand and accept all responsibilities and limitations described herein, including those related to meta-cognition and self-reflective features. Any violation of these terms may result in immediate termination of your rights under this license, and may subject you to legal action by ARL or other affected parties.
